The application will then launch in the browser. Enjoy!

## Testing 

While testing pure HTML and Vanilla JS is uncommon, Tyler Hawkins wrote an excellent [blog post](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-unit-test-html-and-vanilla-javascript-without-a-ui-framework-c4c89c9f5e56) detailing a method to do just that. This application features some basic unit tests that look for DOM elements on the page. These tests can be executed using the command: 

```
npm test
```
